# Disease-and-Symptom-Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes data related to disease symptoms and severity. By integrating datasets on symptom descriptions, severity levels, and precautionary measures, the analysis provides insights into relationships and trends that may help prioritize symptom management and disease response.

Getting Started
Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
Setup and Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure to have the required libraries installed. You can install them with:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) to explore the project.
Data Sources
Symptom Severity: Contains severity weights for various symptoms.
Dataset: Lists diseases along with associated symptoms.
Symptom Description: Provides detailed descriptions for each symptom.
Symptom Precaution: Lists precautionary recommendations for each disease.
Project Structure
Data Loading and Cleaning: Loads each dataset, handles missing values, and prepares the data for analysis.
Data Analysis: Explores trends in symptom severity, merging data to understand disease-symptom relationships.
Visualization: Shows key trends, such as top diseases by average severity score.
Conclusion: Summarizes findings and proposes potential next steps for the analysis.
Results and Observations
The analysis shows patterns in symptom severity and identifies diseases with the highest severity scores. These insights could aid in prioritizing healthcare response based on symptom and disease severity.

Future Improvements
Implement predictive models for symptom severity.
Include demographic data for a more comprehensive analysis.
Explore additional symptom correlations to support diagnostics.
